# flask-example
Flask example for vapor framework comparison

Install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run with
```
python run.py
```

Note that [Flaskâ€™s built-in server is not suitable for production](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/deploying/#deployment) and
this set-up is therefore not suitable for performance comparisons as-is. Proper deployment options are listed on the page linked to.

The example as-is does allow comparing the development aspect of frameworks.
